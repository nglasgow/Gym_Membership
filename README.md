## Description
**Gym Membership** is an app one can use to log in as a user and join training classes. I use 3 different models which are User, Training and Enrollment. Enrollment is my joint model. I am tracking which training the users are enrolled in.

## Installation

Add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise'
```
```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'capybara', '1.1.2'
end
```

Run the following command to install it:

```console
bundle install
```
